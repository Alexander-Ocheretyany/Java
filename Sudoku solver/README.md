To work with the program:

1. Read a file with the extension '.sud'. It must consist of 9 rows and 9 columns where each column is separated by a single space character. Each element of this matrix 
is a digit from 0 to 9 where 0 represents an empty space and 1-9 are values for the fixed places of the puzzle.
2. Manual input. Press the left mouse button and hold it to show a value selector. Hover over the value you want to substitute for the cell you chose and release the left mouse
button. To delete value from a cell hover over the cell and press the right mouse button. When the puzzle is ready press "Solve puzzle" to resolve it.
3. Press "Clear board" to clear the whole puzzle board.
