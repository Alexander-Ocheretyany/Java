The program prints out information about Java types. The program reads from the standard input and prints to the standard output. The program reads names of types (each one on a separate line) and prints information about them - a full name of the type, a kind of the type (a class, interface,...), information whether the type is a generic one (if yes, then a list of the generic arguments separated by a space), a name of the supertype, a number of implemented interfaces, a list of implemented interfaces (in the order as they are returned by the getInterfaces() method), a number of public methods, a number of public static methods, a number of inner classes, a list of names of inner classes (in the order as they are returned by the getClasses() method). Every information is printed out on a separate line. Information about particular types are separated by an empty line. In a case the type does not exists, then the type's name is printed followed by the text "does not exists".
