/* This repository is used to publish my programs written in Java */

1. Text editor - course project for "Java" course. The program is a code editor with highlighting of the keywords of a language chosen. The user can easily add new languages to the program.
2. Messenger - course project for "Java" course. The program is a classic messenger. Originally, the program was written using PostgreSQL and then I switched to Apache Derby due to my teacher's requirements.
