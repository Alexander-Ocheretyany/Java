3. Download Manager - course project for "Programming" course. The program has a user-friendly GUI and allows a user to download multiple files.
4. Probability - a project for the "Probability theory" course. A user "wins" when a dice shows 5 or 6, loses otherwise. To show how the distribution function behaves we can also roll a dice 100 000 times and see its histogram in on-line mode.
